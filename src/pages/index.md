# <span aria-hidden="true">⚔</span>️ Hello, aoe2 nerd!

Welcome to aoe2.studio!

There's not a lot to see here right now because we're just getting started. So instead, let me introduce myself.

I'm [with-heart](https://github.com/with-heart)!

I'm a web developer with a deep passion for open source. I was the first member of the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) core team, a founding member of [Developer DAO](https://developerdao.com/), and I've spent a lot of time drifting around the open source ecosystem contributing to projects like [`xstate`](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate).

I've also been an Age of Empires II player off and on for most of the game's life. Mostly I play 2v2s with my friend Snacks and we're… [not great](https://www.aoe2insights.com/user/3880229/), but slowly getting better!

aoe2.studio is the collision of these two worlds of mine:

Open source development + Age of Empires II = _??????_

I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of free time. I love building tools and teaching people how to do things. I love open source. And I love Age of Empires II!

Now let's see where this goes…

For now, follow aoe2.studio on [GitHub](https://github.com/aoe2-studio) and [X](https://x.com/aoe2_studio) to see where we're heading!
